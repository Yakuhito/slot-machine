# slot-machine

A repo containing the CLI and code use to interact with two slot PoCs running on the Chia blockchain: CATalog and the Chia Name Service (CNS).

## CATalog
A decentralized CAT registration system for the Chia blockchain. It allows CAT creators to register new CATs and add useful information such as name and image URL. Verifiers can then create verification coins to attest things about the data - such that it is not misleading.


# Chia Name Service (CNS)
A decentralized naming system for the Chia blockchain. The first version allows anyone to register a name and associate it to an address.
