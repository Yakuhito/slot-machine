# slot-machine

A repo containing the CLI and code used to interact with two PoCs of the slot primitive built for the Chia blockchain: CATalog and the Chia Name Service (CNS).

## CATalog

A decentralized CAT registration system for the Chia blockchain. It allows CAT creators to register new CATs and add useful information such as name and image URL. Verifiers can then create verification coins to attest that the data is not misleading, as well as assign categories and subcategories to the CAT.


## XCHandles

A decentralized naming system for the Chia blockchain. The first version allows anyone to register a name and associate it to an address. Users receive an NFT that they can fully customize, with the ability to also add fields such as profile pictures.
