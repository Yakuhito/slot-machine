;; Given an inner puzzle and a user-supplied solution, CAT makers return the full puzzle of a CAT
;;   with the given inner puzzle. This allows the registry to support intermediary layers in
;;   future CATs, such as the recently-proposed revocation layer.

;; The default CAT maker assumes no intermediary layers between the CAT outer puzzle and the inner puzzle.

;; Note: Truths (Inner_Puzzle_Hash) are trusted and should be verified by the outer puzzle.
